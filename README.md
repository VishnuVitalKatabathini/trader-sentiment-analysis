Objective:

 To explore the relationship between  market sentiment (Fear/Greed) and trader performance using historical data from Hyperliquid and the Fear & Greed Index. The goal is to identify patterns that can inform smarter trading strategies.



Insights:

Traders are more active and profitable during Greed, though with higher variance.
Fear periods show cautious trading behavior — fewer large trades, lower average PnL.
High PnL does not always align with high trade volume, indicating selective success during sentiment swings.

Conclusion
Are traders more successful during Fear or Greed?
 On average, Greed periods see higher profitability, but they also come with higher risk and volatility.

Does sentiment affect trade volume and behavior?
 Yes — Greed sentiment leads to larger trades, more activity, and riskier positions.
